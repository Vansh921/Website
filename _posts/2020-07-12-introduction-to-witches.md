# BURNED AT STAKE

Hey there! In the previous post i had promised a surprise for all the readers and here it is. This
post is the beginning of something new and I sincerely hope you enjoy reading this as much as I
enjoyed writing it. Today, we will talk about _witches_.

Witches have always been a topic that intrigue the mind of young and old alike. Almost every
culture in the world has its own tale of witchcraft. In its most basic form, a witch can be
described as a person (more often than not, a woman) who dabbles in magic. Many associate
witchcraft with devil worship, the occult and a lot of other negatively perceived topics but more
on that later.

Modern pop-culture sees its fair share of witches and magic. Be it a good one or an evil one,
almost everyone has seen or read about one witch or the other. Some people know of Hermione
Granger and Bellatrix Lestrange from the Harry Potter Universe, while others are more familiar
with names like Sabrina Spellman from the TV series by the same name, Melisandre from
Game of Thrones or even the Wicked Witch of the West from the Wizard of Oz franchise. Even
mythology has numerous witches like Hecate, Circe and Pasiphae.

More often than not, people associate the term witch with an evil, _fictional_ woman who wants
what's best for herself and will go to any lengths to make that happen. As kids, we saw them as
green coloured hags, with black pointy hats, flying around on their magical broomsticks in the
black of the night and worshiping Satan or some other Devil. Most people are not even afraid of
them anymore, since they know that witches are, and have always been, made up.

But what if I were to tell you that witches have always been real? And that they have walked
among us for centuries, disguised as our neighbours, our colleagues, and even our friends.
You would probably ask me to stop living in my fantasy world and face the witch-less reality.
You'd ask me to get real and accept that witches aren't real. But would you say the same to the
thousands of victims who have been tried and executed because of allegations of witchcraft?

Over the next couple of weeks we will take a journey through the history of witches and
witch-hunts. We will talk about a history of witches, the tortures used on them, and witch hunts in
Europe, the United States, and India through a series of blog posts that will be uploaded twice a
week.

The bottom line is that witches _are_ real. They always have been and history is the witness of
that. But the definition of witches throughout history has changed, and so has our method of
dealing with them.

Early witches were thought to be people who practiced witchcraft and magic to call upon
spirts to do their bidding. Most of them were accused to be pagans doing the Devil's work.
Many, however, were simply natural healers and wise women whose choice of profession was
misunderstood. This, in simple words, means that any woman who was smart and was seen
doing something that was originally a man's work was seen as a witch. You're a mathematician
who solved a problem no man could? You're a witch. You, a woman, led a whole army and made
them victorious with your strategic planning? A witch again. I think you get what I mean.

One of the first mentions of a witch can be found in the Bible in the book of 1 Samuel. The Bible
also has some other mentions of a witch. But it was only in the mid-1400s that witch hysteria
took a firm hold in Europe. This happened because whenever something unfortunate happened
with anyone, it was blamed on a woman, often someone belonging to the margins of the society.

Single women, widows, elderly people, the poor. A person belonging to one of these groups
could easily be accused of witchcraft and then they would have to undergo a series of trials that
modern science can easily prove senseless.

Technically, these trials were following law, but in reality, it was nothing but pure, senseless
torture. Many of the accused often confessed to witchcraft and other allegations, but only due
to the excessive amount of torture they had to go through. Then, they would implicate another
woman to save themselves and decrease their punishment. Those who did not accept the
accusations were simply executed by either hanging or burning at stake.

As previously mentioned, almost every culture has their own legend and belief about witches, but
this also means that each of those cultures have their own version of witch hunts as well. Just
about everywhere in the world, at one point of time or another, witches have been hunted, tried
and ultimately executed for a number of reasons.

Some historians have divided the types of accusations the alleged witches were tried for into
the following four general categories:

+ A person who was caught in the act of positive or negative sorcery of any sorts
+ A well meaning natural healer who lost their clients' trust due to some accident or the other
+ An already vulnerable, helpless person gained the enmity of their neighbours
+ Any person who was already reputed to be a witch, of a different ethnicity, and was surrounded
by an aura of Occultism and Paganism

All of this that you've read so far makes it seem like witches were nothing but simply victims
who were accused for doing nothing and lost their reputations, and often their lives in the
process. But there have also been people around who claim to be real witches and there still are.

Modern day witches of the Western World are still struggling to shake their historical
stereotypes. Most witches practice Wicca, an official religion for the witches. Now, Wiccans
avoid evil and anything even closely associated to that at all costs. With a peaceful motto of
"harm none", they mostly live a simple, peaceful and balanced life in harmony with nature and
humanity.

The witches of today still perform witchcraft and spells but nothing about it is sinister. A book
of spells and incantations called the Book of Shadows, a 20-th century collection of witchcraft
knowledge, serves as a supplier for their beliefs and can be compared to the act of prayer in
other religions. Even the potions that are brewed by modern witches are simply herbal remedies
for flu and other illnesses instead of a hex to harm someone.

Even today, witches - whether actual or accused - are still persecuted and killed. Places like
Papua New Guinea, Africa, South America, Middle East, India and even Europe and the United
States still gets reports of several men and women being abused, and sometimes killed, after
being accused of witchcraft.

While this post is coming to an end, in the next one, we will talk about the tortures, physical and
psychological, that many of the accused witches had to face.

Till then, have a safe life.
