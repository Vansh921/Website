#### - Born With The Fear

Hey there! For the past two weeks, you and I have been on a journey together. We have
discussed about witches, cleared some previously stereotyped thoughts about them, learned a
whole lot of facts about the monsters that live amongst us, and the history of witch hunts in the
world.

Since the beginning of this series of blogs on witches, we have always asked and answered
questions like "how", "what", and "when". But, today we try and answer the biggest question there
is to answer. "Why did this even happen?"

For years, scholars have been trying to pinpoint some viable reasons for what caused the
witch hunts at such a scale, and what causes them to still keep going in a hidden manner.
What many agree on is that superficially, the reasons include poverty, superstitions, lack of
education, epidemics, social crises et cetera, but for some reason, this doesn't sit well with me.
I, personally, believe that the reason for witch hunt goes far deeper than that, right into our minds
and the basic coding we're all born with.

In Torture-Fest, we talked about fear being one of the causal factors of the hunts and the
subsequent tortures. But this raises another question: what were the people even afraid of in the
first place? From what I've read, the persecutors had a fear of something that we're all born with
in the first place. __Fear of the unknown.__

In my eyes, whenever the authorities saw an unexplainable phenomenon, they looked for an
explanation. Upon not finding one, they made one of their own, woven from the thin threads of
superstition and stigma, and then forced that explanation on the weakest sect. What was the
result of this? Witches.

Fear of the unknown can also be seen in the stories of people like Tituba, the woman who
started the Salem witch hunts. People like her, and I don't mean ones of the same race, but
people who knew that their lives had almost certainly come to an end, with no ethical alternative
in sight, such people were afraid of the turn their lives were going to soon take, and this fear
drove them to throw their ethics and the thoughts on "good and bad" out of the window, and
do whatever was in their power, just to ensure their survival. If that included blaming someone
innocent, then so be it.

This fear, I believe, is at the core of why the witch trials took place. It might even be at core of
humanity. You and I are afraid of the same things as those people. We don't know if we're gonna
become what we want to become, do what we want to do, get the ending we think we deserve.
We don't know any of this and we hate not knowing. Because of this, we try and take control of
the things around us, sometimes even taking control of others' lives as well. And that scares the
living hell out of us, at least it scares the living hell out of me.

Now, I think we understood a little bit about the fear that drives us to take firm actions, mostly
in our own favour, sometimes against others'. But, another question still bugs me. Even if we
accept that there are people who have magical powers, why do we always assume that it's a
bad thing? And even when it's not, society has often shown a tendency to twist and deform
something neutral or even good, to look like its worst possible form.

In the first blog, I mentioned that many of the accused "witches" were also faith healers or
natural healers who used herbs and potions and the power of nature to heal their patients, and
in case their procedure went wrong once or twice, they would be accused of harming the patient
and then labelled witches. Plus, the fact that the same people who called the healers witches
after one innocent accident also believed that potions made of God knows what will cure
everything always baffles me. On one hand, I come to you and your highly unreliable method for
assistance with my health, and on the other hand, I get mad when the highly unreliable method
doesn't work. Go figure.

Back to the point now, why were most witches even considered evil? I mean look at our history
and upbringing. We're taught at a young age that witches are bad in one way or another. Even the
kind of fantasy movies we're shown often portray an evil witch. Sure, there are good ones too,
but more often than not, if the character is a female and does magic, the character is labelled
evil. Many of those witches are inherently evil, but there are those too who are only seen as evil
when you look at one side of the story.

Biggest example of this? Maleficent. Anyone who's read or seen Disney's Maleficent will know
that the titular character, Maleficent, is not the antagonist. She is just a very powerful being
who was wronged and wanted revenge. Even in real life, why is it so hard for us to believe that
someone with powers beyond the ordinary can do good? Why is it so hard for us to look past
the potential dangers one might possess and just look at the beauty and warmth they offer?

For some reason we have conditioned ourselves to look at the worst in something or someone.
And this trait of ours is not limited to witches and monsters. Oh no, it has far transcended
the world of supernatural and invaded our real lives. Now we second guess everything, show
distrust towards new elements, and are apprehensive towards things that go beyond our
understanding. This condition of ours can be seen as a handicap of sorts. It binds us to our own
beliefs, and in a way, takes away our freedom; the freedom to let new, unknown things in, the
freedom to take risks.

What I'm trying to say is that our instinctive distrust and fear of the unknown, is what caused the
witch hunts so long ago. They have already made us cross the line between man and monster
more than enough times, and, if these instincts are not controlled by us soon, then something
even worse will be born.

In the end, stay safe, stay strong, because you never know which fear of yours might come true
next.

This ends the first series of Myths and Muses. It's been a fun couple of weeks for me. I've
learned so much and I've grown even more. And I can only hope that you had just as fun as I did.

Thank you for sticking by and reading about something so dear to me.
