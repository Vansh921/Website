# It's Not a Box

Hope. Four letters. One syllable. Such a simple word, isn’t it, and yet so powerful. Hope can have
people complete miraculous feats which are normally supposed to be impossible. Hope lets
us survive through a hard time, such a time where giving up looks easier than coping up. But
do we really know what Hope is? Is hope really a good thing? One might agree but here’s my
counter-proposal.

In 700 BC, the Greek poet Hesiod wrote a story about Pandora’s Box, though it was originally
a ceramic jar, also called a pithos. According to this legend, the Greek gods created the first
woman to walk the earth and named her Pandora. They gave her all the skills, talents, knowledge,
beauty and in the end, curiosity. Pandora was originally created in order to extract revenge
from Prometheus, the creator of humankind according to the Greeks. He is also known as the
Titan who gave us fire. The gods couldn’t accept fire, one of their most prized possessions,
being given away to humans. For this heinous act, Prometheus was severely punished, the gods
weren’t convinced of this and decided to punish humans too. Pandora was to be the channel to
punish us. It was decided that she would be given away to Epimetheus, Prometheus’s brother, as
his wife.

Epimetheus had already been advised not to accept any sort of gifts by the gods but when he
saw his wife to be, overcome with lust, he accepted Pandora and the sealed pithos that came
with her as a wedding gift. With the pithos, there was a warning to not open it, ever. Epimetheus
was momentarily confused, but then decided to neglect whatever the message said since it
didn’t even matter. He had a beautiful wife and that’s all he cared for.

From many accounts, it seems Pandora’s love for Epimetheus was real, but she still went behind
her husband’s back, out of curiosity, and decided to open the pithos. When she opened it, a
whole horde of evil spirits escaped the pithos, spreading death, illness, poverty, misery and more
horrible things. By the time Pandora managed to reseal the pithos, only one spirit remained
inside. That spirit was Elpis, the spirit of hope. It is widely believed that the day Elpis leaves the
pithos, the day she left humanity, we would end ourselves.

But here’s the big question: what if all those people are wrong? What if Hope, originally believed
to be a helping spirit, was an evil one? Don’t believe me? Here’s what I have to say. Hope leads
to expectations. Expectations give rise to promises. It’s those promises that are then broken,
leading to betrayal, heartbreak and lack of trust. Along with broken hopes, we have false hopes,
given to children and adults alike. Your parent is sick? “It’ll be alright”, people will tell you, even
when you know that’s not true. And when, gods forbid, something might happen to them, those
false reassurances would all come crashing down on you, adding to the grief, slashing at your
willpower, breaking you down, piece by piece, and in the end, killing the part of you that could
trust, the part that could hope. Hope destroys people. I say so as I have been beaten up and
defeated. All because I had hopes. High ones, mind you. Instead of hoping for a miracle, be the
miracle. Make yourselves so strong that you don’t have to hope. At least not in others. You are
strong. You just need a wake up call. Hope, and might never receive it. Hope, and you might end
up so broken that it is impossible for you to repair yourself.

In the end, I just say that instead of hoping from someone, believe in you. Tell that little
scared part inside you that it may not be okay, not for a long time but here’s when they should
remain strong. Gather courage and tell yourself the hard facts instead of the sugar coated
reassurances. Do this, and you may never have to hope again, for you wont need it.
Whatever I said about Hope being evil makes sense because why else would the gods put in a
little good thing at the bottom of the pithos if it weren’t immeasurably evil. What would happen
if Elpis were let loose when its power can be devastating from inside too? Think of the despair,
destruction and confusion this one word can spread. That’s all I have to convince you of my point
and dare I say, _let's hope for the best_
