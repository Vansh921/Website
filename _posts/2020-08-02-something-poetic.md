#### - Here's to you

Hi there! Today is National Friendship Day here in India and I wanted to do something for my
friends for this day.

I've always thought like I don't do enough for the people I care about and trust, and while many of
them have often disagreed with me on this, I still find it hard to make peace with. So, for today's
blog post I tried writing a little poem for each and every one of my friends.

I've been getting a lot of requests for more poems so I figured today would be a good day. Now,
I know I could've written an article on friendship and taken the examples of some of the best
friendships out there like Hamlet and Horatio, Achilles and Patroclus, Dean and Castiel, Harry
and Hermione, Chandler and Joey, and countless others as well, but when I got to writing that, I
didn't feel the way I often feel while writing blogs. It felt kind of artificial so I decided to scrap the
whole idea and give poetry a shot.

## Something Poetic

I could write something poetic  
Something like a cool summer breeze  
Or the first ray of sunlight after a bout of rain  
But that doesn’t sit well with me  
It just doesn’t feel right.

Me and you, we have more chaos to us  
We hold storms within  
Me and you, together we're forces of power  
Everything about us is akin.

Our friendship is special to me  
It is based  
On me making mistakes  
And you playing along.  
Pointing out my wrong grammar,  
And agreeing to my plans  
(No matter how close  
To trouble they bring us)  
It is based  
On you saying something smart  
And getting raspberries in response.

But the best part about it is  
That we're not friends anymore  
We've evolved and grown  
And are closer to siblings  
Who are always engaged in friendly war.

More than anything  
I am inspired by you  
Inspired by the love you give  
And the strength you shine with.  
I am inspired by the things you do  
And the way you do them  
With a firm resolve  
And a passion like no other.

I could write a dozen more stanzas  
On the friendship of you and I  
Or I could dedicate this one little poem  
To all the people who have loved me  
And have been loved in return  
And to the ones who are not here anymore  
Yet still reside in my memories.

So I don’t know  
How to end poem  
For they are nothing but mere  
Manifestation of the stories and the tales  
I have to tell. And, well stories,  
They never end.

The main purpose of this poem is to highlight the importance of the people I trust. To let them
know I'm grateful for their presence and to make sure they're aware of how much they mean to
me.

Now, this poem and this post isn't only for the people I've known for years or talk to often. It is
equally dedicated to you. You, who come to the site every time there is a new post. You, who
read my write-ups and leave your precious comments. In my eyes, we're already friends. Each
week I pour my heart out in front of you and each week I receive such beautiful response.

So, not making this blog longer than it has to be, I'll be taking your leave for today. Happy
friendship day everyone. Be kind.
