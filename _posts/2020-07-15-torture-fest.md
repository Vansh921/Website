# Witch torture 101 with yours truly

I have walked this Earth for around 17 years now. Sure, I haven't seen everything, not even close,
but I do read a lot. And once, while reading random stuff, I came across the mentions of a
species of animals. The species had a very special type of organisms. Their scientific name is
_homo sapiens_ but we commonly refer to them as humans.

Humans have been around for a long time and we have constantly evolved. It amazes me, the
apparently impossible extent of human intellect. With every passing day, we develop something
new, something better and the next day we create something even better than the last day.

We have created a lot of things and I mean A LOT. That makes us seem like intelligent, sensible
creatures and I believe it's common knowledge that humans have a very specific trait in them.
Something by the name of "humanity". But what scares me to the core of my very existence is
how sometimes we forget about our humanity.

History is the witness of the countless times humans crossed so many lines that they weren't
humans anymore. No, they became monsters then. The same monsters that hide under our beds
and in our closets. The same monsters that plague our dreams.

The biggest examples of humans crossing the line between humanity and monstrosity can be
seen in the witch hunts that sparked across the whole world at different times.

In our previous post, you got a little overview about how witches have always been real and I
also hinted at the torture said witches had to go through. Today, we shall talk exclusively about
some of the most common and horrific techniques our ancestors used on "witches".

**_You're on Myths and Muses, and this is the Torture Fest._**

The emergence of witches led to the emergence of witch hunts where anyone who was accused
of being a witch, man or woman, child or adult, had to go through a trial to prove their innocence.
They got to say their part but obviously, since the witch was accused of working for the devil,
their testimony held little or no value at all.

Instead, they had to go through a series of horrifying tests to prove that they are but an ordinary
human. Some of these tests were simple enough. Assuming a person is in cahoots with the
devil, it is only natural to think that they can't read the scripture. So if a person read the scripture
easily, they were said to have cleared that test.

Not all the trials were as easy, though. Among the most popular methods were the trial by water,
trial by fire, sleep deprivation, and pressing. We shall talk about each of these in some detail now.

The trial by water included the swimming test. The accused would be bound and then thrown
into a body of water. If the body floats, she's a witch, and if it doesn't then she's not. Simple
enough right? Obviously most of them sank in the water, while some floated on the surface
because of the tides and other forces. More often than not, by the time the common people
realised that a person was innocent since they hadn’t come up to the surface yet, it was too late
since the accused would have already drowned. The ones who didn’t were mostly beaten and
killed in uniquely disturbing ways.

The uniquely disturbing ways of murder bring us to the trial by fire. When you hear the word
witch, many of you are taken to the same image: burning at a stake. It was believed that since
the accused is being assisted by the Devil himself, they wouldn't burn. So, they were tied to
a wooden stake and set on fire. If they survived, the people's resolve strengthened that the
accused was a witch. But if they didn't survive the fire, well then they didn't survive at all. Burning
at stake was also used as a final execution instead of punishment and torture for many accused
witches, the Salem Witch Hunts being the best example of it.

Then comes a torture technique that security agencies use even today. Sleep deprivation.
The accused would be sleep deprived for days on an end, often being tortured in other ways
simultaneously. The more time they would spend being tortured, they more of their sanity they'd
lose and ultimately, the accused would confess to witchcraft just to get the torture to stop.
If they didn't though, then they would simply go insane and then finally died a painful, horrible
death. I dont know if sleep depriving someone and making them go insane to get a confession
from them is the most ethical method out there, but I do know from personal experience that
it definitely works. Come see me in school on a monday morning and you'll probably find me
talking about nationalism and secularism and other stuff like that. I know, crazy stuff.

Finally we arrive at the last method of torture: Pressing. Pressing, as a torture technique, is also
fairly easy to understand and just as sadistic and inhumane. A person would be laid on a slab
while weights would be gradually added to their chest. As their rib bones were slowly cracked
and often crushed under the weight, a confession of witchcraft would come out on its own.

The subject of pressing compels me to mention Giles Corey, an 80-year old man from Salem,
Massachusetts, accused of witchcraft and tried by pressing. Every historical document states
that Corey continuously hollered "More weight!" before being crushed to death. I think it's the
most metal thing one ever can do and I know you agree with me.

You didn't think this was it did you? There are some other traumatising tortures that I can't help
but mention. The list includes, but is not limited to, the Pear of Anguish where a metal pear
shaped object would be inserted in one of the opening of the accused, mostly either the anus or
the nostrils and then, the device would be expanded manually inside its victim until the person
confessed or just stopped breathing. Now, I get that this is probably one of the most innovative
and just as terrifying methods of torture but I really wish that they had spent just 2% of effort
into naming the device well too.

History also tells us about Witch Cutting and Piercing. I believe these names are self explanatory.
The torturer would take a knife and slowly start cutting one of the limbs of the accused witch
until they either confessed or the limb was removed. This would keep happening over and
over till the final cut at the neck was delivered. Piercing was based on the principle that the
Devil would have marked his minions and by using sharp needles to pierce the accused's body
multiple times, the Devil's mark would be revealed and it would be proven that the accused really
is a witch. Personally, I dont get either of these methods. I mean if I was going to confess about
witchcraft I'd do it when I lose my first limb itself. No point taking all that extra agony when I
know I'll die soon anyway. And piercing? Can you just imagine what would have happened to the
witches' voodoo dolls because of that?

Obviously, under such terrible forms of torture, many people confessed to witchcraft just to
escape the torture. In turn, they often implicated other innocent people as witches and get a
reduced punishment for this service. It was only through this series of implications that the
witch hysteria spread so much in Europe and even moved the United States. As a result, only
during the 16th and 17th century, between 40,000 to 60,000 people were executed because of
the witch hunts. And these are just the numbers of the cases that were officially recorded. I'm
sure there were almost as many people who never even got to trial. For them, the mob would
have probably decided their fate on their own and given them a painfully agonising death.

I have never enjoyed reading about humans torturing other humans but I do believe it is very
necessary. You see, by reading about such cases, we can learn the difference between a man and
a monster. These tortures on witches were inhumane and unnecessarily cruel but they remind
us of our humanity. They also tell us the importance of fear. The tortures used in the witch
hunts were simply fear taking on a physical form. The fear that all the innocent people felt was
released in the way of torture and in the process, it made a murderer out of every single one of
them.

Fear makes us do the craziest things and can only be fought with rational thinking and strong
morals. It is in our hands and our hands only that we ensure that fear doesn't start ruling us.
Because the moment we let it, another witch hunt or something even more hellish would follow
soon.

In conclusion, what I'm trying to say is that Fear is to be feared of. Because if fear runs
unchecked, it's utter and complete mayhem.

In the next post we shall talk about the origin of witch hunts in Europe and how they left their
mark on history. Till then, have safe life and keep your fears in check.
