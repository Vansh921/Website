#### - Abandon the Search for God

Hi there! Welcome, it's been long hasn't it? A series was promised, yes, but before that, I wanted
to talk about something that's been on my mind for a long time. Now, I want you to understand
that whatever you read here, is what I believe in. It is not meant to offend or hurt anyone. So, let's
begin shall we?

***

For years humans have believed in a greater consciousness, aka “God”. The existence of this
greater being is still a mystery to us humans; a mystery which may be solved tomorrow, next
year or maybe after the end of time. But that’s not important.

Many cultures believe there was a single creator of the world, whom they call God, while others
have a different perspective. They put their faith in a whole pantheon of omnipotent deities
who they believe created the world we live in. On the other hand, a couple ancient civilizations
believed that while there are multiple nature spirits we dub as gods, and our worlds and theirs
were created by a different consciousness altogether.

Ancient Egyptians believed that before man, gods used to walk the earth. They were real,
and while they were to be respected and feared due to their magical powers, they were not
something one should worship. Though superior to the humans, the gods were also created
by something. This something was actually “Ma ’at” and “Isfet”. Order and Chaos. The gods
were supposed to uphold Order, and make sure that Chaos doesn’t overcome it and disrupt the
balance of the universe in the process.

One might ask what I believe. According to me, the beings we call gods are just nature spirits.
Personification of different aspects of nature, as one might put it. I believe that humans aren’t
supposed to learn all the secrets that the universe holds, at least not yet. If we were to learn
everything, we would have done that a long time ago.

We seek out for gods to explain the mysteries around us, the miracles, the “magic”, but here’s a
counter proposal: look inside you first. Maybe the questions you have been asking Ra, Indra, Thor
or Zeus are supposed to be answered by you only.

Over the centuries, our religions, our culture, our leaders have been shouting the same thing to
us, with history as the witness. Since a long time, our teachings have been telling us that there
is a nature spirit inside us too. We are gods. We all have different strengths and weaknesses,
and they are what make us special. In the Holy Bible, a physical temple that needs to be built
has been described in great detail. The structure is described as being in two parts – an outer
temple called the Holy Place and an inner sanctuary called the Holy of Holies. The two parts are
separated from each other by a thin veil. While a lot of people have spent hours trying to figure
out the mystery of this temple, science has the answer. The human brain is built in two parts –
an outer part called the dura matter and an inner part called the pia matter. These two parts are
separated by a thin veil of web like tissue. There is a reason why a certain part of our head is
called the temple.

You might be sceptic right now, but there are multiple references like this in the scriptures and
other ancient ideologies. The Bible tells us to “go build our temple", a temple that we must “build
with no tools and making no noise.” What temple do you think it’s talking about? Corinthians
3:16 says that you are the temple of God. The Gospel of John says the exact same thing. Jesus
taught that “the kingdom of God is within you” and even promised us, “the works I do, you can
do... and greater.” The first antipope – Hippolytus of Rome – quoted the same message, first
uttered by the gnostic teacher Monoimus: “Abandon the search for God... instead, take yourself
as the starting place.” The Buddha said, “You are God yourself.” The only difference between you
and God is that you have forgotten that you are divine.

In the end, I conclude by saying that you are a part of nature, a powerful one, in fact. The ancients
knew what they were talking about. All the ancient texts tell us about humans’ divinity, how they
are special, et cetera. The Vedas, the Pistis Sophia, the Zohar, the Shamanic texts, all tell us
about the awesome powers of the human mind and how it can do all the miracles we associate
with God. We forgot about all this the moment we chose to become the created instead of the
creators. Look into yourself and you’ll find the magic.

That was it from my side today. Coming Wednesday, we kick off with our Creation Myths series,
but before that, I want to hear your thoughts, feelings and opinions on this write-up. Let me know
if you agree with me, or believe in something else, down in the comments!
