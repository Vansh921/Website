# MYTHS AND MUSES

Hi there, new reader! Welcome to Myths and Muses. My name is Vansh Sharma, I am a student, and I will be acting as your friendly blogger and host for now.

But first, let me answer a question that I'm sure many of you might be thinking right now, "What even is 'Myths and Muses'? And what makes it different than any other blog that is out there?" Myths and Muses is my brainchild, that took root in my mind as a mere idea when I realised that I should be using my writing talents to work up something productive and display it as well. Time passed, plans were made and cancelled and finally, Myths and Muses came into being. 

Myths and Muses is a platform for me to give voice to my opinions, to talk about the things I love and wish to cherish with anyone willing to be a part of it. On this blog I will be talking about the things that are always on my mind, I will be giving shape to novel ideas and I will also possibly be fanboying a little bit, but that is not all this website is for. Each post is going to have a comments section and the only reason I've put in the comments section is because I want this website to be a place for discussion, a place for collaboration and a place for suggestions.

I want every one reading this to drop whatever ideas are on their mind in the comments, no matter how weird. Actually, the weirder the better. Once you do this, I'll try to see if an article, a story or even a small write up or a poem can be formed out of that one single idea. If you disagree with something I say in any of the posts, email me, spam me with comments, engage with me in any sort of a debate and we shall have a lively and healthy discussion. Because, you see, I dont want this blog to be an outlet for my thoughts and my thoughts only. I want it to serve as an outlet for anyone out there who is in need of one. Be it in the form  of a vent, a diary or maybe even just a place to brainstorm.

Besides this, I ask one thing of every single one of you. I have some big plans and this blog is barely even the first step. In order to achieve said plans, I need to grow, as a writer, and more importantly, as a person and for that I'm going to need the help of you guys, the readers. Whenever you see a window for me to grow, to improve and get better, please point it out to me. I request only this from every reader who is reading this.

This blog is going to be a forum for stories. "What kind of stories?", you may ask. To that I say, every kind. I will be talking about stories here and retelling tales. Tales that many of us might have forgotten about, tales of the old that are still relevant today, tales that make you look back on your choices, tales that make you smile, love and appreciate the world around you.

I will mostly be making my points through the means of the stories of Greek Mythology. I'll be retelling them in my own manner, and then I'll talk about their ever growing relevance and importance in today's changing world. But, along with Greek Mythology, you can also look forward to finding content about Literature, Art, History, Religion, Psychology, Philosophy, Space and a lot more on this single site.

While not being able to stick to a strict schedule of posting, I can assure a steady flow of at least two posts a week.

I believe this has been enough of an introduction for now and i do hope to get to know more of you guys, just as you get to know me and my mind over time.

I will now take my leave with a little bit of information to act as a parting gift. In the next post, which will be live in less than 48 hours, I will be talking about the importance and relevance of my profile picture.

I do hope I'll be seeing some comments. Till then, goodbye and good day
