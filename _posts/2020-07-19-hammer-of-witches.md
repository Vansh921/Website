# On Trial

Hello there! Welcome back to Myths and Muses. The last time you were here, you probably read
about the tortures that "witches" had to go through. These tortures were inhumane and utterly
horrific and we all agree on this.

But today, we will take a brief stroll through the history of witch hunts in Europe and what is
probably the most infamous witch-trial of all time: the Witch-Trials of Salem, Massachusetts.

***

In Early Modern Europe, the witch trials came in waves. There were trials and hunts in the 15th
and early 16th centuries but then the hysteria declined, only to rise up again in the 17th century.

A large part of the European witch-hysteria can be traced back to Heinrich Kramer's Malleus
Maleficarum (The Hammer of Witches), published in 1486. Kramer, as a person, was not special,
if you look past the fact that he wrote a book that was, for over a century, the second bestselling
book in Europe, behind only the Holy Bible.

The book was based on the Biblical command in the book of Exodus 22:18 "Thou shalt not
suffer a witch to live" and argued that Satan, due to the fact that the Apocalypse is coming, has
"Cause a certain unusual heretical perversity to grow up in the land of the Lord - a heresy, I say, of
Sorceresses, since it is to be designated by the particular gender of which he (Satan) is know to
have power."

In simpler terms, The Witches' Hammer stated that all witches, mostly females, were under the
control of the Devil himself and that the other people should wage an all-out war against the
witches. It also explained in detail the many evil practices these alleged witches did, including,
but not limited to, cannibalism and causing male impotence. Because of course that's how you'd
use magical powers if you had them.

I'm sure it's obvious so far Kramer's book did not have a lot of sense and in today's world will be

seen as a misogynistic fantasy fiction. But, at that time, Witches' Hammer was hugely influential.
Many religious authorities approved of the book and then disapproved of it but eventually, it
managed to leave its mark one way or the other.

Kramer's publication, in my opinion, laid the foundations that ultimately led to the final bloody
and lethal form of witch hunting that most of Europe later saw. If you're wondering how lethal,
it is estimated that between 1450 to 1750, over 80,000 people were tried for witchcraft and
almost half of them executed. Did you get your answer? If you didnt, it is "VERY lethal". And again,
these are just the official, recorded numbers, but you get the idea right?

Eventually, after multiple waves of witch-hysteria, it finally died down in Europe. People were
getting tired of hunting down witches and the constant torture. In the second half of the 17th
century, witch hunting in Europe became scant and eventually their growing disfavor led to the
British Witchcraft Act of 1735, which made it illegal to accuse anyone of witchcraft or magic.

Sure, some people were still illegally hunted as witches throughout Europe, but over time
technology took the place of superstition and the witch hunting has been almost completely
eradicated now.

Now we come to the second part of this blog, and quite possibly my favorite: The Salem Witch
Hunts.

Between 1692 and 1693, the town of Salem, in the colonial Massachusetts, underwent a dark
period. Over the course of the witch hunts, more than 200 people were accused of practicing
witchcraft for the Devil himself and at least 20 people and 2 dogs were executed for that.

The history of these trials goes very deep, but today I will try to explain to you the beginning of
the Salem witch trials, because why not?

It all began in January of 1692, when Abigail Williams (age 11) and Betty Parris (age 9) began to
have fits that were described as "beyond the power of epileptic fits or natural disease to effect".
According to an eyewitness, the two young girls were acting strangely, they were contorting
themselves into peculiar positions, screaming and throwing stuff, uttering strange sounds and
were also reported to be complaining about being pinched and pricked by pins.

The local doctor, William Griggs, could found no logical reason for this condition of the girls and
ultimately declared that the current condition of the girls was the work of a witch. Soon, other
young girls of the community began showing similar symptoms too. For reasons unknown, a
Caribbean slave, Tituba, along with the beggar Sarah Good and the poor, elderly Sarah Osborn,
were accused by some of the girls for bewitching them.

Now, I understand why all three of those women were the ones accused. As we previously
discussed, most women accused of witchcraft were the ones on the margins of society and
these three fit the profile perfectly. People of color like Tituba, still haven't been able to come
out of that margin and are still on the margins and largely discriminated against. But I'm sure
you knew that already didn't you? Because you've probably seen it happen and haven't raised
your voice against it. And since you didn't raise your voice when you saw it happen, it would be
hypocritical to assume or wish that someone stood up for Tituba.

All three of them, Tituba, Sarah Good and Sarah Osborn, were soon taken to court, with charges
of witchcraft on them. Good and Osborn continuously denied their guilt but Tituba confessed
soon after the hearings began. Possibly seeking some decreased penalties on her, she struck a
deal with the court and claimed that there were other witches in and around Salem. This sparked
the fire and hysteria which ultimately led to a series of events we call the Salem Witch Hunts
today.

Tituba was freed because of the multiple women she had accused while she was imprisoned,
but Tituba's freedom came at a terrible cost. "What was the cost" you ask? Well the cost was
multiple witch hunts in the state of Massachusetts which resulted in countless lives being lost
and even more being destroyed.

Many people have criticized Tituba for her actions. Sure, her actions made one heck of a mess
and created a lot of chaos but you can't blame the woman. She had no idea about the potential
repercussions of her actions and personally, I believe that if I'm faced with a life threatening
situation where I will be allowed to live a free life by simply confessing to something false, if I'll
get a life of freedom that would have otherwise been impossible, I can not guarantee you that
my morals would still remain standing. The same happened with Tituba. As a human, her actions
were wrong and selfish, but as a black slave in colonial America, that was survival. And would
you not do the exact same thing? Would you not frame strangers for a free life in the New World?
_Would you not sell your soul for liberty in a world where your existence is defined by shackles?_

Nevertheless, the witch hunts had blown up into such huge proportions because of Tituba's
confession that a special Court of Oyer (to hear) and Terminer (to decide) was established for
witchcraft cases only.

Remember the case of the elderly Giles Corey who was crushed to death as he yelled "More
weight!"? He was one of the victims of Salem and no matter how cool and hardcore he may
seem to us now, we need to keep in mind that it was a terrible ordeal and in many ways, inhuman
too.

There's a lot more to the history of Salem witch hunts and the ones in Europe too. Just as there
is a lot to learn about the hunts in Africa and India and multiple others places. But, time and
world limit bind us here.

This series of blogs dedicated to witches is coming to an end soon, and so is this particular
blog, but as its ending, I want to let you all know just because we are talking about the history
of the world and witches here, it does not mean that witch hunts have stopped. Even today,
countless men and women are accused for witchcraft and killed brutally, and the only way to
make this world safe for potential victims of the witch hysteria is to educate ourselves and the
ones around us. Read up on witches, their origin and history. Learn more about them and get the
facts straight. And most importantly, spread the truth you learn so that no innocent's life is in
danger because of a reason as illogical as this. For all we know, one wrong move, and you and I
could be the next ones to be burned on stake.
