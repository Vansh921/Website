# Your Personal Hell

Hi there! Welcome back. I have a little task for everyone today. I want you to think of the perfect,
unproblematic society. Think of a place where everything is good and nobody has complaints of
any sorts. Sounds like a really nice place, doesn't it? Yeah, we're not talking about that today.

What you just pictured was your own personal Utopia, a place or a society deemed to be perfect,
and that place is completely impossible. Now, I want you to go back to your Utopia, and think
of a place that is exactly its opposite. That beautiful, new, and horrific place is what we call
Dystopia. Acting as Utopia's direct opposite, Dystopias are societies often found in popular
fiction where one will find a lot of suffering, a society full of pain and loss and often poverty, as
dehumanizing and unpleasant as possible. Sounds a lot like the current scenario of society, I
know, but another characteristic of Dystopia is the fact that it is often set in the future. Plus, just
like its counterpart, Dystopia is also unattainable.

Now, I'm sure the concept of Dystopia might seem alien and new to some of you, but I am
pretty sure almost all of you must have come across examples of Dystopia in fiction at least
once. Some of you must've read books like Animal Farm, 1984, Fahrenheit 451, Hunger Games,
or Divergent. Others may have seen movies and shows like Blade Runner, Planet of the Apes,
Resident Evil, Purge, Matrix, the Handmaid's Tale, or maybe even X-Men: Days of Future Past. All
of these works of fiction represent one Dystopian society or the other.

I believe it's safe to assume that you have an idea of what a Dystopian society is. But still the
question remains: _what_ makes a society truly Dystopian, when pain and loss and suffering
exist just about everywhere? And _why_ do we even need stories about a place where humans
exist but humanity does not?

Generally, Dystopian works of fiction explore the dangerous effects of certain political and
social structures on humanity's future. According to Margaret Atwood, author of the 1985 novel,
The Handmaid's Tale, most Dystopian novels have one or more of the following as their central
themes:

+ Government Control (1984, The Hunger Games)

+ Environmental Destruction (Brave New World, Feed)

+ Technological Control (The Road, The Maze Runner)

+ Survival (Lord of the Flies, The City of Ember)

+ Loss of Individualism (Fahrenheit 451, The Giver)

This answers our first question about "what". If your fictional society has any or all of these
themes, it qualifies as Dystopian. I know, a lot of this feel true to our real world too and one
might argue that this makes our reality a Dystopia as well, but that's really a topic for another
day.

Before we come to the "why" part of Dystopia, I want to introduce, in brief, the 4 major types
of Dystopia we might see. The classifications are __"Orwellian", "Huxleyan", "Kafkaesque",
"Phildickian".__ Orwellian Dystopia is characterized by a rule by autocratic totalitarian people,
party or elite group. Huxleyan Dystopias have a democratic, totalitarian, capitalist, technocratic
system rule established. Kafkaesque Dystopias are often ruled by a bureaucracy. On the other
hand, Phildickian Dystopias have a rule by replacing reality with an abstract, substitute virtual
image of it.

Now, back to our final question: the "why". I can't say I have the exact reason about why did
humans ever come up with such horrible societies but I do have a hunch. You see, a lot of the
works of literature based around a Dystopian society are satirical critiques by the author. Others
may convey an author's beliefs while some act as a way to warn and educate humanity about the
dangers of certain socio-political structures.

But, for me, our strange attachment with Dystopia goes deeper than that. Dystopia, the whole
concept of it, really, seems to me a lot like personification. Humans, as a society, have often
personified their deepest fears and desires. Similarly, we all have a certain way of how we do not
want to exist, our living hells, if you may. Often, this living hell is strong and it crosses from our
subconscious thoughts to our mainstream thought process. As writers, some people are able to
give these thoughts a shape in the form of a society and a whole new, yet familiar world. They do
this to warn us of the dangers of that world, to make sure people know of the repercussions of
events like the ones in the Hunger Games, or the way our world will change if we get a leader like
Big Brother from the novel 1984.

Dystopias are projections of our own inner realities and what makes them even more beautiful is
the Lovecraftian Horror vibe. Older readers would seem to recall when we talked about the fear
of the unknown. That's kind of what Lovecraftian Horror is.

While Lovecraftian Horror goes beyond the single line you just read, everyone has their own
Dystopias, each of them just as unpredictable as the next one, and this unpredictability of our
personal Dystopias is what gives the whole idea of a broken society the element of horror.

With this, we arrive at the end of this lovely little journey. All I can say while taking your leave is
that while complete Dystopia is impossible to attain, a part of it still exists in the way we interact
with society, and in the way one interacts with us, and all we can do to make sure the monsters
and dictators from our Dystopias don't escape into the real world is to keep a vigilant check on
our own selves. As long as we're doing that, we shall remain safe.

This was all on Dystopia for now. I do hope this write-up managed to spark an interest in you
about Dystopias. Do let me know your thoughts and suggestions in the comment! Until then,
goodbye.
